            <h2>It Started With a Simple Question</h2>
            <p>
                "Why can't AI create a simple blog header without looking like abstract art gone wrong?"
            </p>
            <p>
                That's the question that started LayoutCraft. As a solo founder, I'd spent countless hours 
                with tools like Midjourney and DALL-E, trying to generate something—anything—that looked 
                professional enough for my startup's blog. The results? Beautiful chaos. Artistic masterpieces 
                with text that looked like it was written in an alien language.
            </p>

            <h2>"This is a Terrible Idea"</h2>
            <p>
                When I shared my frustration on r/design, suggesting that maybe AI could be trained to create 
                <span class="highlight">structured layouts instead of artistic chaos</span>, the response was... memorable.
            </p>
            
            <div class="quote-block">
                "This is soulless. You're trying to replace human creativity with a machine. Design requires 
                a human touch, empathy, and understanding that AI will never have."
            </div>
            
            <p>
                One particularly passionate designer called me a "scumbag" for even suggesting it. Others 
                explained, at length, why AI would never understand "real" design principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                And you know what? They were partially right. LayoutCraft isn't trying to replace designers. 
                It's not for them. It's for the millions of us who <span class="highlight">need design but 
                aren't designers</span>.
            </p>

            <h2>Building for the Underserved</h2>
            <p>
                Every day, thousands of founders, developers, marketers, and small business owners need visual 
                content. We don't need award-winning artistic expression. We need:
            </p>
            <ul style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #4b5563;">
                <li>Blog headers with readable text</li>
                <li>Social media posts that don't look homemade</li>
                <li>Presentations that appear professional</li>
                <li>Marketing materials that convert</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Traditional AI image generators treat every prompt like a request for art. LayoutCraft treats 
                prompts like requests for <span class="highlight">functional design</span>.
            </p>

            <h2>The Technical Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                Without getting too deep into the technical weeds, LayoutCraft works differently. Instead of 
                generating pixels directly, our AI first creates a structural blueprint—think of it like an 
                architect drawing plans before building. This ensures proper hierarchy, readable text, and 
                consistent layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not perfect. It's not trying to be. It's trying to be <span class="highlight">useful</span>.
            </p>

            <h2>The Response That Matters</h2>
            <p>
                When we launched on r/SaaS and r/indiehackers, the response was completely different:
            </p>
            
            <div class="quote-block">
                "FINALLY. I've been waiting for something like this. Designers keep telling me to hire them 
                for $500 blog headers. This does exactly what I need."
            </div>
            
            <p>
                600+ users in the first 18 hours. Hundreds of messages from founders who felt the same 
                frustration. The validation was clear: there's a massive gap between what designers think 
                people need and what non-designers actually need.
            </p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                LayoutCraft is still in its early stages. We're adding features based on real user feedback, 
                not design theory. Things like:
            </p>
            <ul style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #4b5563;">
                <li>Brand consistency tools</li>
                <li>Multi-format export</li>
                <li>Template systems</li>
                <li>And yes, eventually, the ability to export to actual code</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Join the Revolution</h2>
            <p>
